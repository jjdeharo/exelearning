# ADR-2293-01: Own iDevice edition resources with an explicit lifecycle

## Context

An iDevice editor is a classic script that assigns a single global,
`var $exeDevice = { init, save, addEvents, ... }`. The workarea loads it, calls
`$exeDevice.init(ideviceBody, ...)`, and the script builds its form and binds
its handlers. When the editor closes, `IdeviceNode` sets `$exeDevice = undefined`
at three sites: `loadEditionIdevice()`, `restartExeIdeviceValue()` and
`remove()` (`public/app/workarea/project/idevices/content/ideviceNode.js` @
`64df99f22`).

Nothing else happened at those sites. The edition's handlers, timers and pending
asynchronous callbacks stayed alive, and the edition form was only replaced
later — `ideviceBody.innerHTML = ...` runs inside `exportProcessIdeviceHtml()`
and `exportProcessIdeviceJson()`, after the global has already been cleared.
Anything firing in that window dereferenced `undefined`.

Issue #2271 recorded 15 Sentry issues and 56 events of exactly that shape across
four iDevices. PR #2278 fixed the reported call sites with
`if (!$exeDevice) return;` guards and `$exeDevice?.method()`. Reviewing it,
@ignaciogros observed that the guards treat the symptom: the same pattern exists
in the other edition scripts, and a newly added handler reintroduces the bug.
Issue #2293 asks for the lifecycle fix.

## Problem

How should an iDevice edition own the resources it creates, so that none of them
can run after the edition has been closed — and so that a new iDevice can be
opened without inheriting anything from the previous one?

## Decision drivers

- **Correctness beyond the reported crashes.** Guarding a call site stops a
  `TypeError`; it does not stop the wrong iDevice being mutated.
- **Genericity.** 55 edition scripts exist and more are added over time. The fix
  must not be a list of guarded call sites.
- **Blast radius.** Edition scripts are legacy, lightly typed, and only partly
  covered by tests. A change that rewrites all of them is riskier than the bug.
- **No new runtime dependencies.** The workarea ships as a bundle plus classic
  scripts; `AbortController` is already used in `public/app/yjs/` and
  `public/app/rest/`.
- **Precise removal.** Edition scripts bind handlers to `document` and `window`,
  which are shared with the rest of the application. Teardown must not remove
  anything it does not own.

## Options considered

### Option 1: Keep adding per-call-site guards (the #2278 approach)

Continue with `if (!$exeDevice) return;` in every handler.

Pros: tiny, local, already proven to remove the user-facing errors.

Cons: does not scale to 55 scripts; every new handler is a new opportunity to
forget; and, decisively, it does not fix the dangerous case. When a stale
callback runs, the global usually holds a *valid* object — the iDevice the user
just opened. The guard passes and the callback drives the wrong instance.

### Option 2: Remove the edition form DOM before clearing the global

The approach suggested in the issue. `IdeviceNode` unbinds the form with jQuery
(which, unlike native removal, also drops jQuery's event and data registry for
the subtree) before releasing `$exeDevice`.

Pros: small, central, kills every form-local handler at once — the large
majority of what edition scripts bind.

Cons: incomplete on its own. It does not touch handlers bound to `document`,
`window` or elements outside the form; it does not cancel timers; and it does
not stop a pending `FileReader`, image load or player callback.

### Option 3: An explicit lifecycle object owning the edition's resources

Give every edition instance an `EditionLifecycle`: an identity, an active/
destroying/destroyed state, an `AbortController`, and a registry of disposers.
Edition scripts register timers, listeners, abortable work and third-party
instances through it. `IdeviceNode` disposes it before clearing the global, and
performs the Option 2 form teardown as one step of that sequence.

Pros: covers every resource class; teardown is deterministic and idempotent;
callbacks registered through it are bound to the owning instance, which is what
closes the cross-instance hole; adding a new iDevice has one obvious pattern.

Cons: a new abstraction to learn; migrating the existing scripts is real work.

## Evidence

- The three clearing sites and the absence of any teardown around them:
  `public/app/workarea/project/idevices/content/ideviceNode.js:1646`, `:1767`,
  `:3214` @ `64df99f22`.
- The form is replaced only after the global is cleared:
  `exportProcessIdeviceHtml()` and `exportProcessIdeviceJson()` in the same file
  assign `this.ideviceBody.innerHTML` during `loadInitScriptIdevice('export')`,
  which begins by calling `restartExeIdeviceValue()`.
- jQuery removes its event and data registry for a subtree only when jQuery
  performs the removal (`.remove()`, `.empty()`); native removal leaves the
  registry entries behind — jQuery 3.7.1 documentation for
  [`.empty()`](https://api.jquery.com/empty/) and [`.remove()`](https://api.jquery.com/remove/).
- jQuery event namespaces remove exactly the handlers carrying that namespace
  and leave others on the same target registered —
  [`.off()`](https://api.jquery.com/off/), jQuery 3.7.1.
- `AbortSignal` passed to `addEventListener` removes the listener on abort, for
  any target — [MDN, `AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal).
- TinyMCE 5.10.2 is the bundled version (`public/libs/tinymce_5/js/tinymce`),
  and `editor.remove()` is its documented per-instance teardown.
- `AbortController` already ships in the frontend: `public/app/rest/SSEClient.js:152`,
  `public/app/yjs/AssetWebSocketHandler.js:1248`.
- Audit of all 55 edition scripts plus the shared edition helpers for this
  change: the resources that can outlive a form are timers, `document`/`window`
  handlers, and asynchronous callbacks; form-local handlers die with the form.

## Decision

We will adopt **Option 3, with Option 2 as one of its steps**.

`EditionLifecycle`
(`public/app/workarea/project/idevices/content/editionLifecycle.js`) owns the
resources of one edition instance. `IdeviceNode.initExeDeviceEdition()` creates
one and publishes it as `$exeDevice.$lifecycle` and `window.$exeEditionLifecycle`
before calling `$exeDevice.init(...)`. All four clearing sites now call one
`IdeviceNode.destroyEditionInstance()` — the three above plus
`IdevicesEngine.destroyEditionIdevices()`, before a page change wipes the
content wholesale. It:

1. stops the initialization poll;
2. disposes the lifecycle — marking it inactive first, then cancelling timers and
   aborting the signal, running the iDevice's optional `destroyEdition()` hook
   while its instance and DOM are still available, running registered disposers
   in reverse order, and removing jQuery handlers by the edition's own namespace;
3. removes the TinyMCE editors whose target is inside the form, while those
   targets are still in the document;
4. unbinds the edition form through `jQuery.cleanData`, dropping its event and
   data registry while leaving the markup on screen until the export view
   replaces it;
5. clears `$exeDevice`, last.

Ownership is derived, never mirrored: the active lifecycle lives in a single
module slot and names its `ownerNode`, so a node asks "is the open edition mine?"
instead of holding a reference that could go stale. A node that owns no edition
leaves the open one — and `$exeDevice` with it — untouched, which is what keeps
collaborative sync from stranding a live editor while it re-renders a remote
iDevice through the export path.

Callbacks registered through the lifecycle are bound to the device that owned it,
so a callback created by edition A can never operate on edition B.

Edition scripts are migrated for the resources that can actually outlive a form —
timers, handlers on shared targets, asynchronous callbacks and third-party
instances. Form-local handlers are deliberately **not** rewritten: step 4 already
removes them, and rewriting roughly a thousand of them would be a far larger
change than the defect. The #2278 guards are kept.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Use-after-destroy and cross-instance callbacks are both structurally
  prevented, not merely guarded against.
- One teardown path instead of three ad-hoc ones.
- Teardown is idempotent and survives a failing disposer, so a cleanup bug
  cannot strand the application with a half-destroyed editor.
- New iDevices get one documented pattern for events, timers and disposal.
- The optional `destroyEdition()` hook is kept although no iDevice needs it yet:
  it is the only teardown that runs *before* the registered disposers, which run
  last and in reverse order and so cannot express "clean this up first".

### Negative

- A new abstraction that iDevice authors must learn.
- Two access paths (`this.$lifecycle` and `window.$exeEditionLifecycle`) exist,
  because the shared edition helpers run outside the device object.

### Neutral

- One deliberate exception to "the edition owns its resources": the LOMLOE
  tooltip controller is a page-scoped singleton whose `__lomloeTipBound` guard is
  shared with `lomloe/export/lomloe.js`. Releasing it on close would kill every
  other LOMLOE tooltip on the page, with nothing able to reinstall it.
- `isSync` keeps its meaning: a synchronized reload deliberately preserves the
  open editor, so teardown does not run there.
- Guards added by #2278 stay. They are now redundant in the paths the lifecycle
  covers, but they are harmless and still protect scripts as they are migrated.

## Risks

- **Migration coverage.** A resource missed during the audit stays leaked. Low
  severity — the behaviour is no worse than before the change.
- **Speculative API.** Migrating the scripts is the experiment that says which
  helpers earn their place; those that ended it unused were removed. A helper is
  justified only when it encodes a cleanup recipe a bare `own()` disposer would
  get wrong at each site — as `ownMedia()` and `ownFileReader()` do. Review added
  two more on the same test: `readFile()`, because `abort()` fires no `error`
  event and a bound `loadend` no-ops, so a promise wrapped around a reader by
  hand never settles and its caller awaits it for the lifetime of the page; and
  the optional slot on `ownMedia()`, because a resource the edition rebuilds on
  every click — the audio preview — otherwise leaves one more live element and
  one more disposer behind per click.
- **Over-eager teardown.** Emptying the form at the wrong moment would destroy
  data the editor still needs. Mitigated by ordering: `$exeDevice.save()` runs in
  `saveIdeviceProcess()` before `loadInitScriptIdevice('export')` reaches
  `restartExeIdeviceValue()`, and by the `isSync` exemption.
- **Test harness drift.** Edition tests load scripts directly, so they need a
  lifecycle too; `global.loadIdevice` attaches a real one.

## Validation

- Unit tests for the lifecycle itself, exercising real jQuery 3.7.1, a real
  `AbortController` and Vitest fake timers, including the regression that a
  callback from edition A reaches neither A nor B.
- Unit tests for `IdeviceNode` teardown ordering, idempotency and every close
  path.
- Per-iDevice tests for each migrated resource.
- A Playwright spec covering edit → save, discard, delete and open A → open B,
  asserting no page errors.

## Follow-up work

- Migrate any resource class discovered later to the lifecycle rather than
  adding a new guard.
- Consider removing the #2278 guards once every affected script is migrated and
  covered; they are intentionally left in place for now.
- Replace the one-off static sweep with a runtime leak sentinel in
  `public/vitest.setup.js`, asserting after `destroy()` that an edition left no
  timer, listener or observer behind. It beats a source regex: it sees aliased
  receivers (`doc.addEventListener`) and leaks from the libraries the scripts
  inject themselves, and it cannot fire on correct code. Biome cannot serve this
  role — it must never run over this tree (AGENTS.md section 6), which
  `biome.json` now enforces by excluding it.
