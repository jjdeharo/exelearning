# ADR-2316-01: Minimum score to pass an activity, resolved at runtime

## Context

Until this change eXeLearning had no shared notion of what "passing" an activity
meant. Three unrelated places decided it, each with its own hand-written number:

- `public/app/common/common.js`, `report.saveEvaluation()` compared the mark
  against a literal `5` on the 0-10 scale every iDevice computes `scorerp` on.
  That single comparison also selected the message the learner reads, because
  `showEvaluationIcon()` derives `msgSuccessfulActivity` /
  `msgUnsuccessfulActivity` from the state it stores.
- The SCORM 1.2 runtime policy used `DEFAULT_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD = 50`, a
  percentage of the page aggregate
  (`public/app/common/scorm/scorm12/exe-scorm12-policy.js:86`).
- The legacy path (SCORM 2004 and packages exported before the SCORM 1.2 runtime
  rewrite) compared the aggregate against a literal `50` in `showFinalScore()`.

Some iDevices had grown their own answer as well. `form` shipped a pass-rate
dropdown **the runtime never read** — it judged everyone at a hardcoded 50 %
while `$form.passRate` stayed `''` for the life of the page. `rubric` grades
internally on its own 0..maximum scale, and was also the one scoring iDevice that
never registered in the progress report at all.

Authors asked for one configurable threshold. What this ADR settles is not
whether to add the option, but **where the value lives once it exists**, and what
shape the code that consumes it takes.

## Problem

An authoring tool writes content once and that content is played many times,
often long after the project was last opened. When a project-wide setting governs
per-activity behaviour, the value can either be **copied into every activity when
it is saved** or **resolved when the activity runs**. The two are
indistinguishable on the day the content is written and diverge permanently
afterwards.

## Decision drivers

- **Authoring intent.** An author who never customises an activity expects it to
  follow the project, including after they change the project.
- **Reach of a correction.** A threshold set wrongly across a 200-page course
  must be fixable in one place, not in 200 activities.
- **Already-published content.** Nothing may change how an existing package
  grades while the feature is present but unused.
- **File-format cost.** Every key added to `<odeProperties>` and to each
  iDevice's stored data is a key the importer, the exporter and every future
  reader must keep honouring.
- **Number of iDevices.** Anything an iDevice has to remember to do is something
  35 of them can get wrong, and that a 36th will not know about.
- **LMS authority.** A teacher configuring an activity inside Moodle is more
  specific than an author configuring content months earlier.

## Options considered

### Option 1: copy the project value into each iDevice on save

The edition form prefills with the project value and stores it in the iDevice's
own data. The runtime reads only what the iDevice carries.

Pros: no new channel between the project and the exported page; the stored value
is self-describing; plainly inspectable in `content.xml`.

Cons: the project option degenerates into a default for *new* activities.
Changing it later leaves every existing one on the old mark, silently and
invisibly — the author cannot tell which activities followed the project and
which were customised, because once stored they are identical.

### Option 2: resolve the project value when the activity runs

An iDevice stores only the author's choice. "Follow the project" stores nothing;
the page publishes the value and the runtime resolves it on load.

Pros: inheritance stays live for the life of the content; one correction reaches
every non-customised activity; "not customised" is representable as the absence
of data, so old content reads correctly without migration.

Cons: needs a channel from the project to the exported page, which did not exist.

### Option 3: resolve at runtime, but let each iDevice re-implement the rule

Pros: maximum per-iDevice freedom; no shared code to agree on.

Cons: 35 copies of one condition, which is exactly how `form` ended up with a
control the runtime ignored.

## Evidence

- The SCORM page aggregate is a weighted mean, not a per-activity verdict:
  `aggregateScore()` computes `sum(normalizedScore * weight) / sum(weights)` in
  `public/app/common/scorm/scorm12/exe-scorm12-activities.js`. A page verdict
  that respects each activity's own mark has to aggregate the marks the same
  way, or the page and its activities answer different questions.
- Judging the page by the project mark alone contradicted the activities in a
  real LMS. In Moodle, with the project left at 5, a crossword customised to 7
  scoring 66.7 was marked passed and one customised to 3 scoring 33.3 failed,
  while each iDevice's own report said the opposite. Reproduced with the
  exported package against a Moodle-like API: `$exe.passScore.resolve()` gave 7
  and 3, and the policy judged both at 50.
- Keeping the mark out of `cmi.suspend_data` broke restarting a resumed
  activity. Traced in the exported crossword: `initGame()` opens the session,
  so `applyEntryPolicy()` runs over an empty registry and the restored record,
  judged by the page's 50, derived `failed` for a stored `passed` reached at 3.
  The stored verdict was not recognised as the policy's own, and replaying the
  activity left `passed` next to a 0, with `cmi.core.exit` still `""`. The
  weight never had this problem because it is stored with the record.
- `minimumScore` in the activity registry is **not** a threshold:
  `normalizedScore()` computes
  `((score - minimumScore) / (maximumScore - minimumScore)) * 100`, i.e. the lower
  bound of the scale. Setting it to 5 would turn a raw 50 into 47.4, rescaling
  every learner's mark instead of demanding a higher one.
- `form` shipped a pass-mark dropdown the runtime never read: `showScore(50, data)`
  was called with a literal and `$form.passRate` was declared `''` and never
  assigned (`public/files/perm/idevices/base/form/export/form.js`, before this
  change). Evidence that option 3 does not hold over time.
- `interactive-video` carries the same scar in its `weighted` field: it read a
  root-level key nothing ever wrote, so every activity weighed 100 whatever the
  author chose. Evidence that a field an iDevice must remember to list is a field
  it will eventually forget.
- The SCORM 1.2 policy already adopted `cmi.student_data.mastery_score` when the
  LMS publishes one (`resolveSuccessThreshold()`), which is the precedent for
  letting the LMS override content.
- New projects are not seeded with export options: `YjsDocumentManager`
  initialises only title, author, language, licence, theme and dates. Defaults
  are applied by readers, which matches option 2 and not option 1.
- `geogebra-activity` reports through the button alone and fixes `isScorm: 2`
  (`public/files/perm/idevices/base/geogebra-activity/export/geogebra-activity.js`),
  so it has no moment at which to report automatically.
- `rubric` already reports out of ten: `calculateScormScore()` divides the marks
  by the table maximum and multiplies by ten
  (`public/files/perm/idevices/base/rubric/export/rubric.js`). An activity that
  converts to 0-10 to report has no reason to be configured on another scale.
- `rubric` made no call to `gamification.report` at all before this change,
  which is why it never appeared in a learner's progress report.
- The weighted mean lets one activity make up for another, and that is visible
  in a real package. A page with three scoring activities was marked `passed`
  with its true/false activity at 0, because the other two lifted the mean of
  the scores above the mean of the marks. Reproduced by playing the exported
  package against a simulated SCORM 1.2 API.

## Decision

We adopt **option 2**. The twelve decisions below are listed in order of
importance: the first five constrain the file format and the behaviour of
already-published content; the rest follow from them and could be revisited
without touching the first five.

### 1. Inheritance is resolved at runtime, not copied on save

An iDevice stores only the author's *choice*: follow the project, or this
specific mark. "Follow the project" **stores nothing**. The page publishes the
project value and the runtime resolves it on load.

Direct consequence: changing the project option moves every non-customised
activity with it, including those saved months ago. And because "not customised"
is the absence of data, all content predating this feature reads correctly **with
no migration at all**.

### 2. The project → page channel is a META tag

No channel existed: `PageRenderer` emitted no global configuration of any kind.
Every exported and previewed page now carries:

```html
<meta name="exe-pass-score" content="5">
```

It travels as a META rather than an inline script for two verifiable reasons:
EPUB forbids inline scripts by CSP, and the parser sees the tag before
`libs/common.js` runs.

### 3. SCORM threshold precedence: LMS > activities' marks > project > historical 50

The SCORM 1.2 policy settles its threshold least specific first: the historical
50, then the mark the page publishes, then the **weighted mean of the
activities' own marks**, then `cmi.student_data.mastery_score` if the LMS
publishes one. **The LMS wins on purpose**: `mastery_score` is what the teacher
configured on the activity in their own platform, and that is more specific than
what the author chose when building the content months earlier.

Each activity declares its mark to the registry when it registers
(`successThreshold`, the resolved 0-10 mark ×10), and the page is judged against
the mean of those marks over the same activities and with the same weights as
the aggregate score. An activity that declares none counts at the project mark.
Three properties follow, and they are why this shape was chosen over requiring
every activity to pass its own mark:

- A lone activity is judged by its own mark, so the LMS and the iDevice's own
  verdict agree on a page with one activity.
- A page whose activities all follow the project is judged by the project's
  mark, so content that never customises an activity grades as it did.
- The page passes when `sum(weight × score) ≥ sum(weight × mark)`: an activity
  above its mark can make up for one below it, exactly as its score already
  does in the aggregate.

That is the default, not the only rule: an author who needs every activity to
pass its own mark turns on a project option (decision 11).

The mean is computed on every decision rather than resolved once, because
activities keep registering after the session opens. The mark is **stored with
each record in `cmi.suspend_data`**, as an optional ninth field, for the same
reason the weight already is: the entry policy recognises its own earlier
verdict only when the restored registry derives that verdict again, and a game
iDevice opens the session from `initGame()` before it registers. A live
declaration still replaces the stored mark, as it does the weight. The field is
optional and last, so the payload version does not change and an older runtime
reads the record and ignores the mark.

The first version of this decision judged the page by the project mark alone and
left the activity's own mark to the progress report. That made the LMS and the
activity disagree, which is the report in the Evidence above.

### 4. The domain is 0-10 with one decimal, and 0 is a legitimate value

The default is 5. A non-numeric value falls back to 5 and **not to 0**, because 0
means "any mark passes" and must stay distinguishable from "not set" — a
`parseFloat(x) || 0` would quietly turn every unset threshold into "everyone
passes". That distinction also forced the correction of a truthiness check
(`if (passRate)`) that hid the verdict when the threshold was 0.

The default of 5 out of 10 is exactly the historical 50 %, and a package with no
META falls back to it: **no existing content changes how it grades**.

### 5. One resolver for every consumer

`$exe.passScore` owns the resolution: `get()` reads the META in an exported page
and the live Y.Doc in the editor; `resolve(data)` answers for one iDevice;
`normalize()` enforces the domain; `toPercent()` converts to the 0-100 scale of
the activity registry. No iDevice repeats the condition.

This works because `common.js` is the same file in both worlds: loaded from
`workarea.njk` in the editor and shipped as `libs/common.js` in the package.

### 6. A single place composes the grading controls

The SCORM tab becomes the **Grading** tab, and `getTab(path, options)` composes
the three blocks that answer the same question — what counts as passing: SCORM,
Progress report and Minimum score. Previously the pass score and the report sat
loose in each iDevice's general options, laid out by hand, so the author had to
look in two places.

Cases that cannot offer something are expressed with composition flags
(`passScore: false`, `hideautosave`) rather than letting each iDevice trim on its
own. The accepted trade-off: any change to that function reaches all 35 tabs at
once.

"Grading" rather than "Evaluation" is deliberate: the iDevice menu already has an
"Assessment and tracking" category, and the tab is narrower than either — no
criteria, no instruments, no rubrics.

### 7. Three persistence conventions coexist, unified nowhere

Three shapes are in use and none needed a migration, precisely because the
absence of data is meaningful (decision 1):

| Shape | Where | How the mark is stored |
|---|---|---|
| Options JSON | most iDevices | `passScoreMode` and `passScoreCustom` in the stored object |
| CSS classes | `geogebra-activity` | `auto-geogebra-pass-score-N`, written only when customised |
| Serialised payload | `interactive-video` | fields on `activityToSave`, which is JSON-stringified |

Unifying them would mean migrating every `.elp` ever saved — large, risky, and
unrelated to the feature that was asked for.

Three iDevices build their options object field by field instead of spreading the
stored data (`geogebra-activity`, `interactive-video`, `rubric`), so in those the
fields must be listed explicitly or they never reach the runtime. This is the
trap the `weighted` bug above fell into.

### 8. Every activity is configured on the same scale, with no exceptions

`rubric` grades internally from 0 to whatever its first level adds up to, so a
mark in its own units was considered — the author reads "Maximum score: 16" on
screen. It was rejected, for two reasons that only became clear once the runtime
was traced.

The rubric **already reports out of ten**: `calculateScormScore()` divides by the
maximum and multiplies by ten before sending. So the learner reads "Your score:
6.25" out of ten while the author would have been configuring out of sixteen —
two scales for the same thing inside one activity.

And on a page with several scoring iDevices, that 6.25 enters the weighted mean
alongside the others. With a threshold in rubric units, the author had no way to
compare what they demanded of the rubric with what they demanded of its
neighbours on the same page.

The same argument closes the general case: an activity that grades on a scale of
its own converts to 0-10 to report, so it can convert to 0-10 to be configured.

### 9. `geogebra-activity` does not offer the automatic mode

Its construction has no end of its own — the learner may keep dragging it
forever — so there is no moment at which to report by itself. Of the three modes,
the one it cannot honour is hidden rather than offering an option that would do
nothing. Its former "Save score button" checkbox encoded exactly the two modes it
can honour, so the radios replace it without losing a capability.

### 10. The threshold decides passing, not completion

`completed` in the activity registry still means *finished*, not *passed*. A
failed activity is still a finished one, and conflating them would leave a
learner who finished but did not pass with a page stuck at `incomplete`.

For the same reason **`minimumScore` was left alone**: despite the name it is the
lower bound of the scale, not a threshold (see Evidence).

### 11. The author can require every activity to reach its own mark

Decision 3 lets a high mark make up for a low one, and some pages must not
allow it: a well-done crossword should not pass a page whose safety quiz was
failed. A project option, **off by default**, changes the page verdict:
`passScoreEveryActivity`, stored as `pp_passScoreEveryActivity`. Once every
required activity is complete, the page passes only when each evaluable activity
reaches its own mark, or the project mark if it declares none. Both sides are
rounded to two decimals, as the activity's own report compares them, so the
page and the activity agree at the exact boundary.

It is an option rather than a change to decision 3 because both readings are
legitimate, and because existing projects and published packages must grade as
they did (see Decision drivers). The page publishes it as a second META, written
only when the option is on:

```html
<meta name="exe-pass-score-every-activity" content="true">
```

A page without that META grades exactly as decision 3 describes. That covers
every package exported before the option existed and every project that leaves
it off.

- **Only the status changes.** The score sent to the LMS is still the weighted
  mean of decision 3.
- **The LMS and content still win.** When the LMS publishes `mastery_score`, or
  content sets a threshold with `setSuccessThreshold()`, the page is judged by
  its aggregate against that value, as before. That threshold is a mark for the
  whole page, and Moodle applies `masteryoverride` at `LMSFinish` anyway.
- **SCORM 1.2 stores nothing new.** The rule needs each activity's score and mark, and
  both are already in its record in `cmi.suspend_data` (decision 3). A resumed
  attempt therefore derives the same verdict, and the entry policy recognises
  it as its own.
- **Legacy SCORM (2004)** has no registry, so `common.js` judges the activities
  it knows by page position, through the activity states of decision 12. The
  page is judged only once every activity is finished, so the 0 the legacy path
  writes for each activity as it registers never fails a page the learner has
  not touched. A submitted 0 stays finished after a resume, including when its
  mark is 0.

### 12. SCORM 2004 judges a page only once its activities are finished

SCORM 2004 packages use the legacy runtime, which has no registry. Until this
change it wrote SCORM 1.2 element names (`cmi.core.lesson_status`,
`cmi.core.score.raw`) to the SCORM 2004 API, which rejects them, so nothing it
decided reached the LMS. What did reach it came from the exit: the exported page
calls `unloadPage()` with no argument from its body attributes, before
`exe_export.js` can pass `isSCORM`, and that call marked any page that was not
yet terminal `completed` and `passed`, answered or not.

Writing valid element names alone made it wrong in another way. The legacy path
judged the page every time an iDevice registered, counting the 0 it seeds for
each activity as a score. A page opened and left became `completed` and `failed`
with a score of 0, and `quit()` then ended the attempt with `cmi.exit = normal`.

The legacy path therefore keeps apart the three things the SCORM 1.2 policy keeps
apart ([ADR-2209-02](ADR-2209-02-scorm12-activity-completion-registry.md)):

- **Whether there is a score.** `cmi.score.raw` is written only once an activity
  has sent one.
- **Whether the activities are finished.** Each activity is pending (registered,
  no score), scored, or finished. Only the bridge's `completed: true`, sent when
  the game is over, finishes it. A score sent from the button in the middle of a
  game does not, as in the SCORM 1.2 runtime contract (§9.1), and the latest
  report decides, so a replay that reports `completed: false` reopens the page.
  While an activity is not finished, the page is `incomplete` and `unknown`,
  and the exit is `suspend`.
- **Whether the page is passed.** Once every activity is finished, the page is
  `completed`, and `passed` or `failed` by the weighted mean of decision 3, or by
  each activity's own mark under decision 11. A `cmi.scaled_passing_score` set
  by the LMS judges the page's score instead, under either rule, as
  `mastery_score` does in SCORM 1.2 (decision 3). `cmi.score.scaled` is not
  written: with both set, the LMS works out `success_status` itself when the
  session ends, and would mark `failed` a page that is still incomplete.

The states travel in a separate, versioned line at the end of the payload,
`exe-state/1:1=2,2=0` (page position and state), with the existing `.\t`
separator. The score lines do not change, and an older runtime ignores the
line. A payload written before it has no states. A positive score then counts
as finished, because the activity was played. A 0 cannot be told apart from the
placeholder, so it stays pending until the activity reports again. Rewriting
such a payload does not make up states for it.

Only activities that send a score (`isScorm > 0`) are tracked, as the registry
tracks only evaluable ones. Any other activity would keep the page pending for
ever. Entry and exit (`SCOFunctions.js`) decide from the same stored states under
either rule, so the argument-less exit no longer completes an unfinished page.
At entry, the verdict the LMS holds is kept until an iDevice registers, because
the activities' own marks are not known before that. It waits for the first one
only: until every activity has registered, a finished one still missing counts
at the project's mark, so the verdict written in between is provisional and is
corrected as the rest register (see Risks). A page with no activities
keeps the view-only rule and is completed by being viewed.

## Changes introduced

### Storage and format

- `Y.Map('metadata').passScore`; it travels through ELP/ELPX as
  `<odeProperty>pp_passScore</odeProperty>`.
- `metadata-properties.ts` gains a third property type (`number`) alongside
  `string` and `boolean`, holding the domain, the normalisation and the META name.
- The value is not seeded when a project is created: readers apply the default.
- Each SCORM 1.2 registry record in `cmi.suspend_data` gains an optional ninth
  field with the activity's mark (0-100), under the same `exe12/1` version.
- `Y.Map('metadata').passScoreEveryActivity`, a boolean that defaults to
  `false`; it travels as `<odeProperty>pp_passScoreEveryActivity</odeProperty>`
  and, when `true`, as `<meta name="exe-pass-score-every-activity">`. An ELP
  without it imports as `false`.
- The legacy line format of `cmi.suspend_data` (SCORM 2004) gains a last line,
  `exe-state/1:`, with each activity's state: pending, scored or finished.

### Path of the value

```
config-params.ts → API /parameters → ProjectProperties → form
                                          ↕ YjsPropertiesBinding
                                Y.Map('metadata').passScore
                                          ↓
                 YjsDocumentAdapter → ExportMetadata.passScore
                                          ↓
              OdeXmlGenerator → <odeProperty>pp_passScore</…>   and
              PageRenderer   → <meta name="exe-pass-score">
                                          ↓
                    ElpxImporter / xml-parser → back into the Y.Map
```

`passScoreEveryActivity` follows the same path. `PageRenderer` writes its META
only when the value is `true`.

### Interface

- A new `number` field type in the project properties form, with `min`/`max`/`step`
  declared in the property definition.
- A checkbox under the minimum score in Export options, "Each SCORM activity
  must reach its minimum score", whose help text explains the
  weighted mean that applies while it is unchecked.
- In SCORM exports, a label before the page's score shows the minimum score to
  pass the page, on the same 0-100 scale ("Minimum score to pass: 60/100"), or
  says that each activity must reach its own when that rule decides the page.
  It shows whatever decides the status: the LMS's threshold when it sets one,
  otherwise the activities' marks and the project mark. `showPagePassScore()`
  in `common.js` draws it, and the SCORM 1.2 policy answers through
  `getPassRule()`. Scores are kept to two decimals, so the label rounds the
  threshold up to the lowest score that passes (45.004 shows as 45.01). The
  verdict keeps every decimal the LMS gives.
- The **Grading** tab, with three sections headed alike.
- Four collapsible help notes written from what the runtime does: what each of
  the three SCORM modes implies, and that the weight is a proportion between
  weights rather than a percentage of the total.
- `gamification.help` (`icon`, `note`, `bind`) avoids the sixth copy of the same
  anchor, inline sizing and delegated handler.

### Where the threshold applies

- Progress report and the learner's message: a single comparison in
  `saveEvaluation()`.
- SCORM 1.2: `reportActivity()` declares each activity's mark to the registry,
  `activities.successThreshold()` averages them, and the policy settles the
  threshold in four layers.
- Legacy SCORM (2004): `registerActivity()` records each mark by page position
  and `getFinalThreshold()` averages them with the same weights as
  `getFinalScore()`; a test pins the two averages against each other.
- With every activity at its own mark (decision 11): in SCORM 1.2,
  `activities.unmetThresholds()` lists the activities below their mark, and
  `decideStatus()` answers with the reason `own-marks-evaluated`. On the legacy
  path, `getLegacyVerdict()` applies it once the activities are finished
  (decision 12). Both read the META, the first directly and the second through
  `$exe.passScore.requiresEveryActivity()`.
- SCORM 2004 status under either rule (decision 12): `getLegacyVerdict()` in
  `common.js` decides the completion and success statuses from the activity
  states, `setLegacyStatus()` writes them with the SCORM 2004 element names, and
  `showFinalScore()`, `loadPage()` and `unloadPage()` all go through it.

### Scope

- **35 of 35** scoring iDevices have the shared Grading tab and the shared 0-10
  control. No iDevice opts out.
- `3dmol` and `electrical-circuits` migrate their own progress report to the
  shared block.
- `rubric` gains a progress report, which it never had: it was the one scoring
  iDevice that never registered, so a course mixing rubrics with other
  activities produced a report the rubrics were missing from, and its threshold
  had nowhere to show a verdict. It also gains the four translatable strings
  `showEvaluationIcon` needs, which it lacked.
- Removed along the way: `form`'s dead dropdown, and `getGamificationTab()`,
  which called two helpers that do not exist and which no iDevice ever invoked.
- The legacy SCORM quiz's `passRate` (0-100), which the importer copied into
  that dropdown's field, now imports as the `form` activity's own mark
  (`passRate / 10`). 50, eXe 2.x's default, cannot be told apart from a choice
  and is left to inherit the project's mark, as is a missing or invalid rate.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Changing the project option moves every non-customised activity with it, in
  content published years earlier, on the next export.
- One resolver stops an iDevice from ignoring the threshold by oversight.
- The absence of data is meaningful, so none of the three persistence shapes
  needed a migration.
- Three hand-written numbers and one control that did nothing are gone.
- SCORM 2004 packages report a status the LMS accepts, and a page is completed
  only when its activities are finished.

### Negative

- Exported pages now depend on a META tag. A consumer that stripped unknown META
  elements would silently fall back to 5 rather than failing.
- A saved iDevice is no longer self-describing: reading its stored data does not
  tell you the mark it will be judged by.
- Any change to `getTab` reaches all 35 tabs at once.
- Two page verdicts exist, chosen per project, so the same scores can pass a
  page in one course and fail it in another.
- A SCORM 2004 page that used to end `completed` and `passed` on leaving now
  stays `incomplete` until its activities are finished. An activity stored as a
  0 by an older runtime has to be played again before the page can complete.

### Neutral

- The domain and the normalisation exist in
  `src/shared/export/metadata-properties.ts` and again in
  `public/app/common/common.js`, because the runtime cannot import TypeScript.
- `geogebra-activity` stores the threshold through its own convention (CSS
  classes) but publishes the same two fields to the shared resolver, so the
  difference stops at the storage layer.

## Risks

- **Divergence between the two copies of the rule** (TypeScript and JavaScript).
  Both are covered by tests and name each other in comments, but they can drift.
- **A stale META in a cached page.** Low: it is regenerated on every export and
  preview.
- **Authors reading "Weighted" as a share of the page.** Mitigated with a help
  note, not with code.
- **Top-level declarations in an edition file.** The editor re-injects those
  files with a `<script>` tag on every open, so a module-level `const` breaks the
  second edition with "Identifier has already been declared". It happened during
  this work; a test now pins the rule.
- **A runtime older than the every-activity META.** Such a runtime ignores the
  META and grades by the weighted mean. That includes any host that plays
  packages with its own copy of the SCORM 1.2 runtime, such as the eXeLearning
  Moodle plugin, until that copy is updated.
- **A provisional SCORM 2004 verdict while the page loads** (decision 12). On a
  revisit, the page is judged again as each iDevice registers, and an activity
  finished in an earlier session counts at the project's mark until its own
  registers. With marks of 3 and 9, scores of 40 and 60 and a project at 5, the
  first registration writes `passed` ((30+50)/2 = 40 against 50) and the second
  corrects it to `failed` ((30+90)/2 = 60). The wrong verdict stays if the
  learner leaves in between, or if an iDevice never registers. Accepted: the
  window is narrow, and SCORM 2004 is being phased out, so no more legacy logic
  is added for it.

## Validation

- Unit tests cover the domain and the normalisation on both sides of the language
  boundary, the adapter, the five exporters, the importer, the XML parser, the
  policy precedence and the per-activity verdict.
- `test/e2e/playwright/specs/project-pass-score.spec.ts` walks the whole path:
  the field in project properties, the value in the Y.Doc, the META in the
  previewed page and `$exe.passScore.get()` inside the iframe.
- The claim that nothing changes for existing content is pinned by a test
  asserting that a page publishing no threshold keeps `DEFAULT_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD`.
- The page verdict is pinned at unit level for a lone customised activity on
  either side of the project mark, for weighted pages, for activities with no
  mark of their own, for the LMS and content overrides and across a resumed
  attempt, with the activity registering on either side of the entry policy.
  `scorm12-sco-runtime.spec.ts` exports a rubric customised to 8 in a project
  at 5 and plays it against a strict SCORM 1.2 API: 7.5 is `failed`, clearing
  it on a second visit reopens the attempt, and 10 is `passed`. A second test
  does the same with a Relate game, which registers after the session opens;
  it fails against a runtime that does not store the mark.
- For `map`, whose six game modes each end differently, a test asserts that all
  of them still report through a single `saveEvaluation` funnel — the property
  that lets the threshold reach every mode without touching the runtime.
- Decision 11 is pinned at unit level in the registry, the SCORM 1.2 policy and
  the legacy path. Those tests cover a high mark making up for a low one, every
  activity at its mark, the two-decimal boundary, the LMS and content
  overrides, a pending activity and a resumed attempt. Without the META, the
  existing tests keep the weighted mean. `project-pass-score.spec.ts` checks the
  checkbox and finds the META in the preview. `scorm12-sco-runtime.spec.ts`
  exports with the option on and gives one activity 70 against a mark of 80 and
  another 100 against 40: the mean (85 against 60) would pass, but the page is
  `failed`. A new attempt with 80 is `passed`.
- `scorm2004-contract.test.js` runs the shipped legacy scripts against
  `scorm-again`'s independent SCORM 2004 API, rejecting invalid data-model writes,
  and leaves through the argument-less `unloadPage()` the exported page calls.
  Under both rules it covers a page opened and left, a half-answered page,
  scores sent without finishing, a finished page, a restored 0 at a mark of 0, a
  payload from an older runtime and an informational page.
  `scorm2004-sco-runtime.spec.ts` exports from the editor and plays the package
  below that API: with the option, it reopens a submitted 0 at a mark of 0;
  without it, an unanswered page stays `incomplete` with exit `suspend`, and a
  finished one is judged by the mean.
- The page's minimum score label is pinned at unit level for both runtimes, the
  LMS threshold (`mastery_score`, `cmi.scaled_passing_score`), the every-activity
  rule and a page with no text for it. The SCORM 2004 contract checks that a
  `cmi.scaled_passing_score` judges the page under either rule. Both runtime
  specs find the label before the score in an exported package.

## Follow-up work

- Verify in a real Moodle that a project mark is overridden by an activity-level
  `mastery_score`, asserted at unit level only so far.
- Verify decisions 11 and 12 in a real Moodle. So far they have been tried only
  against simulated SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 APIs.
- The exported SCORM 2004 page still calls `unloadPage()` with no argument
  before `exe_export.js` can pass `isSCORM`. Decision 12 makes the argument
  irrelevant for pages with activities; removing the body attributes was left
  out of this change.
