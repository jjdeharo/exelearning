# Translation System

## Overview

eXeLearning uses XLF (XLIFF) files for internationalization. Translation files are stored in the `translations/` directory and loaded at server startup.

## Supported Languages

The application supports these interface languages:

| Code | Language |
|------|----------|
| `en` | English (default) |
| `es` | Español |
| `ca` | Català |
| `va` | Valencià |
| `eu` | Euskara |
| `fr` | Français |
| `gl` | Galego |
| `pt` | Português |
| `eo` | Esperanto |
| `ro` | Română |

Additional locales are available for exported content packages (see `src/services/translation.ts` for the full list).

## Translation Files

Translations are stored as XLF files in `translations/`:

```
translations/
├── messages.en.xlf
├── messages.es.xlf
├── messages.ca.xlf
├── messages.eu.xlf
├── messages.fr.xlf
├── messages.gl.xlf
├── messages.pt.xlf
├── messages.eo.xlf
├── messages.ro.xlf
└── messages.va.xlf
```

## Using Translations

### In TypeScript (Backend)

```typescript
import { trans } from '../services/translation';

// Simple translation
const message = trans('welcome.message');

// With parameters
const greeting = trans('hello.user', { name: 'John' });
// Parameters support both %param% and {param} formats
```

### In Nunjucks Templates

```njk
{{ trans('page.title') }}
{{ trans('welcome.user', { name: user.name }) }}
```

### In JavaScript (Frontend)

```javascript
// GUI translations (workarea UI strings)
const label = _('Export page');

// Content translations (iDevice content strings)
const text = c_('Page title');

// Template literals are also supported
const html = `<span>${_('Save')}</span>`;
```

## Generated Sources: Build Before Extracting

The extraction scans the working tree, not the dependency graph. Some of the strings it
must find no longer live in files the repository commits: they belong to libraries
vendored out of a pinned npm package into a scanned path by the build, and left
gitignored. `public/app/common/edicuatex/` was the first one — `scripts/vendor-edicuatex.ts`
writes it as the first step of `build:all` — and `public/app/common/sirena/`, the Mermaid
diagram editor vendored by `scripts/vendor-sirena.ts` from the pinned `sirenaapp` package,
the second. Both scripts share `scripts/vendor-package.ts`, and **they will not be the
last**, because the project is steadily moving third-party code from hand-maintained
copies to pinned packages.

This matters because a checkout that has not been built looks completely normal to the
scanner. Every other source scans fine; the key set simply comes out short. That is
harmless while only adding keys, and destructive under `--remove-obsolete`, which treats
the extracted set as the whole truth and deletes every trans-unit outside it from every
locale — around 675 of them, in every language, for `edicuatex` alone.

A tree that is *present* can be just as short. An interrupted vendor run leaves a
directory that exists and holds some of its files, and the strings in the files it never
wrote are exactly as invisible to the scan as if nothing were there at all — with the
difference that an existence check reports everything is fine. A tree can also be *stale*:
bump the dependency and run `bun install` without `make vendor-edicuatex`, and every file
is still there with the previous version's contents, so the strings only the new one
carries look obsolete. Both count as incomplete.

Three things keep that from happening:

1. `make translations`, `make translations-cleanup` and `make translations-sort` depend on
   `vendor-edicuatex` and `vendor-sirena`, so the trees are regenerated before anything
   reads them. Running
   through `make` is always safe.
2. The commands warn when a registered tree is absent **or incomplete**, and
   `--remove-obsolete` refuses to run at all. This is what protects a direct
   `bun cli translations …` invocation, which bypasses `make`. The refusal can be
   overridden with `--allow-missing-generated`, which is destructive by design — use it
   only when you know the missing tree holds no strings.
3. `GENERATED_SOURCE_DIRS` in `src/cli/commands/translations.ts` is the registry the
   warning and the refusal read. Each entry may carry an `inspect` hook that compares the
   tree on disk against what its generator would write; `edicuatex` and `sirena` use
   their vendor script's own plan through `inspectVendoredTree` in
   `scripts/vendor-package.ts`, the same knowledge behind `--check`, rather than a second
   list that could disagree with it —
   files that are missing *and* files whose contents differ, since either hides strings.
   Without a hook, an entry falls back to the existence check. A hook whose package is
   absent altogether reports nothing: there is no pinned version to compare against, and
   `--extract-only` and `translations:sort` delete nothing, so they must not start
   depending on `node_modules`. A package that is *half-installed* is the opposite case —
   the vendored tree is then whatever the previous version left behind, and nothing can
   say whether it still matches — so it is reported as incomplete: the two non-destructive
   commands still only warn, while `--remove-obsolete` refuses.

### When you vendor a new library

**If a library carrying translatable strings starts being vendored from an npm dependency
into a scanned path, add it to `GENERATED_SOURCE_DIRS` in the same PR**, give the entry an
`inspect` hook built on the vendoring script's own file plan, and add the `vendor-*` target
to the three translation targets in the `Makefile`. Nothing detects the
omission automatically: the symptom is the silent one above, and it surfaces as strings
disappearing from every locale weeks later.

A vendored tree does **not** belong in the registry when either is true:

- It is committed to git rather than gitignored, so a checkout always has it —
  `public/app/common/exe_math/` (MathJax), by the decision in
  [ADR-2259-01](../architecture/adr/ADR-2259-01-generate-vendored-mathjax-tree.md).
- It is excluded from scanning in `EXCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS`, so its strings were never
  extracted in the first place.

## Translation Commands

### Extract New Translation Keys

Scan source files for translation function calls and add new keys to XLF files:

```bash
# Extract keys for all locales
make translations

# Extract for a specific locale
make translations LOCALE=es

# Only extract (no cleanup) — equivalent to make translations
bun cli translations --extract-only
```

### Clean and Remove Obsolete Keys

Remove entries that no longer exist in the source code (destructive — irreversible without git).
Read [Generated Sources](#generated-sources-build-before-extracting) first: run through `make`,
or this command deletes every string that lives only in a tree the build generates.

```bash
# Clean all locales
make translations-cleanup

# Clean a specific locale
make translations-cleanup LOCALE=es

# Equivalent CLI command
bun cli translations --clean-only --remove-obsolete
```

### Sort Trans-Unit Order

Reorder `<trans-unit>` elements in all XLF files so they follow the same order as `messages.en.xlf`. Before sorting, the command verifies that `messages.en.xlf` is in sync with the source code and exits with a list of differences if it is not.

```bash
# Sort all locales
make translations-sort

# Sort a specific locale
make translations-sort LOCALE=es
```

XML comments inside `<body>` (e.g. `<!-- Section name -->`) are discarded during sorting, as they would be out of context after reordering.

### Format XLF Files

Normalise `<target>` content and fix indentation in all XLF files:

- Wraps `<target>` content in `<![CDATA[...]]>` when it contains characters that are invalid as raw XML (bare `<`, or `&` not followed by a predefined entity reference such as `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`).
- Already-wrapped CDATA sections and valid plain-text targets are left untouched.
- Normalises indentation: 6 spaces before `<trans-unit>`, 8 spaces before `<source>` and `<target>`.
- Skips `messages.en.xlf` by default (English is the source language; its `<target>` entries mirror `<source>` and never need CDATA normalisation).

```bash
# Format all locales (except "en")
make translations-format

# Format a specific locale
make translations-format LOCALE=es

# Equivalent CLI command
bun cli translations:format
bun cli translations:format --locale=es
```

### Other CLI Options

```bash
# Extract + clean in one pass (no removal of obsolete keys)
bun cli translations

# Only clean formatting/invalid entries (no removal)
bun cli translations --clean-only

# Process a specific locale
bun cli translations --locale=es --extract-only

# Force removal despite a missing generated tree (destructive; see Generated Sources)
bun cli translations --clean-only --remove-obsolete --allow-missing-generated
```

### Recommended Command Order

When doing a full translation maintenance cycle, run the commands in this order:

```bash
# 1. Remove obsolete keys (strings removed from the source code)
make translations-cleanup

# 2. Extract new keys from source code into all XLF files
make translations

# 3. Sort all XLF files to match the canonical order of messages.en.xlf
make translations-sort

# 4. Wrap any <target> values that need CDATA and normalise indentation
make translations-format
```

All four commands accept an optional `LOCALE=xx` argument to restrict the operation to a single language.

## Extraction Sources

The extractor scans these directories and file types:

| Directory | Extensions | Patterns detected |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| `src/` | `*.ts` | `trans('key')`, `` `${TRANS_PREFIX}Key` `` |
| `views/` | `*.njk` | `'key' \| trans` |
| `public/app/` | `*.js` | `_('key')`, `c_('key')` |
| `public/libs/` | `*.js` | `_('key')`, `c_('key')` |
| `public/files/perm/idevices/` | `*.js` | `_('key')`, `c_('key')` |

## Controlling What Gets Extracted

The extractor has three mechanisms to exclude strings, all in `src/cli/commands/translations.ts`.

### `EXCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS` — skip entire files or directories

Regex patterns matched against the full file path. Any file whose path matches is skipped entirely:

```typescript
const EXCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS = [
    /\.spec\.ts$/,           // Backend test files
    /\.test\.js$/,           // Frontend test files
    /[\\/]+exe_math[\\/]+/,  // MathJax (has its own _() calls)
    /[\\/]+node_modules[\\/]+/,
    // Admin panel excluded — see "Admin Panel" section below
    /[\\/]+views[\\/]+admin[\\/]+/,
    /[\\/]+app[\\/]+admin[\\/]+/,
    /[\\/]+routes[\\/]+admin/,
];
```

To exclude a new directory, add a regex entry here.

### `EXCLUDE_EXACT_KEYS` — skip specific strings by exact value

A `Set<string>` of exact key values to ignore. Use this when a file contains strings that look like translation calls but are not UI labels (e.g. math expressions, code examples):

```typescript
const EXCLUDE_EXACT_KEYS = new Set([
    'P + \\\\tfrac12 \\\\rho v^2 + \\\\rho g h = \\\\text{constant}',
    // ^ Bernoulli equation example in edicuatex lang file
]);
```

Note the double escaping: each `\\` in the source file on disk becomes `\\\\` in a TypeScript string literal (since the extractor reads raw file text, not evaluated JS values).

### `INVALID_KEY_PATTERNS` — skip keys matching a pattern

Regex patterns matched against extracted key values. Keys matching any pattern are silently discarded. Used to filter out test fixture strings and documentation examples that accidentally match translation patterns:

```typescript
const INVALID_KEY_PATTERNS = [
    /^test\./,         // test.key, test.something
    /^pattern\./,      // pattern.trans, pattern.t
    /^nonexistent\./,  // nonexistent.translation.key
    /^key$/,           // just "key"
    // ...
];
```

## Admin Panel

The admin panel (`/admin`) is **always displayed in English**, regardless of the user's locale. This is intentional: the admin interface targets technical users and keeping it in a single language simplifies maintenance.

### How it works

Translations for the admin panel are built by `buildAdminTranslations(locale)` in `src/routes/admin.ts`. The call site in `src/routes/pages.ts` hardcodes `'en'` as the locale:

```typescript
// src/routes/pages.ts
const t = buildAdminTranslations('en'); // Admin panel is English-only
```

The admin source files (`views/admin/`, `public/app/admin/`, `src/routes/admin*`) are also excluded from the main translation scanner via `EXCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS`, so their strings never appear in the XLF files.

### Enabling translations for the admin panel

If you want to translate the admin panel into other languages:

1. **`src/routes/pages.ts`** — replace `'en'` with the `locale` variable:

   ```typescript
   const t = buildAdminTranslations(locale); // re-enabled translations
   ```

2. **`src/cli/commands/translations.ts`** — comment out the three admin exclusions in `EXCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS` (currently lines 43–45):

   ```typescript
   // Comment the following 3 lines to scan the admin panel
   // /[\\/]+views[\\/]+admin[\\/]+/,
   // /[\\/]+app[\\/]+admin[\\/]+/,
   // /[\\/]+routes[\\/]+admin/,
   ```

3. Run the normal extraction workflow to populate the XLF files:

   ```bash
   make translations
   ```

4. Translate the new `<target>` entries in each `translations/messages.*.xlf` file.

## Adding a New Language

1. Add the locale to `LOCALES` in `src/services/translation.ts`:

```typescript
export const LOCALES: Record<string, string> = {
    en: 'English',
    es: 'Español',
    fr: 'Français',  // New language
    // ...
};
```

2. Create the XLF file:

```bash
cp translations/messages.en.xlf translations/messages.fr.xlf
```

3. Update `target-language` in the new XLF file's `<file>` element, then translate the `<target>` entries.

4. Run extraction to add any missing keys:

```bash
make translations LOCALE=fr
```

## XLF File Format

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xliff version="1.2" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2">
  <file source-language="en" target-language="es" datatype="plaintext">
    <body>
      <trans-unit id="abc123" resname="welcome.message">
        <source>Welcome to eXeLearning</source>
        <target>Bienvenido a eXeLearning</target>
      </trans-unit>
    </body>
  </file>
</xliff>
```

- `resname` — the key as it appears in source code (XML-escaped if it contains `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`)
- `<source>` — the English string
- `<target>` — the translated string; empty means untranslated

## Locale Detection

The server detects the user's locale from:

1. User preference (stored in session/profile)
2. `Accept-Language` HTTP header
3. Default locale (`en`)

```typescript
import { detectLocaleFromHeader, setLocale } from '../services/translation';

const locale = detectLocaleFromHeader(request.headers.get('accept-language'));
setLocale(locale);
```

## Best Practices

- Use natural-language strings as keys (`_('Export page')`) rather than dot-notation keys (`_('menu.export.page')`); this is the established pattern in this codebase.
- Run `make translations` after adding any new translatable strings.
- Run `make translations-cleanup` periodically to remove keys that no longer exist in the source.
- Run `make translations-sort` to keep all XLF files consistently ordered (makes diffs easier to review).
- Run `make translations-format` to wrap any `<target>` values that require CDATA and normalise indentation.
- Never hardcode UI strings — always wrap them in `_()`, `c_()`, or `trans()`.
