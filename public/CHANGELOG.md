# CHANGELOG

## v4.0.6 – Unreleased

### Added

- Mermaid diagrams: the Mermaid button of the text editor now opens Sirena, a diagram editor that shows the code next to the drawing, with examples, syntax help and visual formatting tools (colours, shapes, arrows, typography). Existing diagrams open in it with their maximum width and height, and "Insert" writes them back in the same format as before
- Sirena is translated into every language of eXeLearning; Catalan (CA), Basque (EU), Galician (GL) and Spanish (ES) use its own translations, and the rest are automatic placeholder translations pending review

### Fixed

- Preview: the first preview after opening a project no longer waits about 5 seconds, and the preview now recovers by itself when its worker stops responding during a session

## v4.0.5 – 2026-09-16

### Added

- iDevice boxes: you can now choose between the icons provided by the current style and the new General icons catalogue (Google's Material Icons); included styles have been updated to support both icon catalogues
- Math editor: added fullscreen and settings controls, reworked the menu and updated texts
- New EducaBlue style: a modern responsive blue design with dark mode and colours and typography meeting WCAG 2.2 level AA
- Local users can now change their password from the user menu
- Administrators can now reset local account passwords from Admin → Users
- Added `make change-password EMAIL=user@example.com` command to change a user's password without showing it on screen
- Password changes are unavailable for guest accounts; users signed in through CAS, OpenID Connect or SAML change their password with their identity provider
- Form, True/False, Scrambled list, Complete and Before/After iDevices: added the option to show a button to save the score
- True/False iDevice: added configurable number of attempts
- Word Search iDevice: added the option to hide the time icon in timed activities
- Platform integration: `PROVIDER_URLS` now supports wildcard subdomains and matches against the address host, allowing multi-tenant deployments to be authorised without widening the allow-list
- Added `assets:conflicts` command to list and resolve asset storage conflicts, keeping either the old or new copy
- Updated development documentation and improved development tools
- Reviewed and completed the Spanish (ES) and Galician (GL) translations
- Restored the French (FR) translation from version 3, corrected its errors and added new automatic placeholder translations for previously untranslated strings
- Added automatic placeholder translations for new strings in incomplete translations

### Changed

- Project assets are now stored in sharded folders with paths relative to the data directory, improving scalability and allowing the data directory to be moved, remounted or restored without invalidating projects; existing installations are converted automatically at startup
- SCORM 1.2: rewritten the runtime shipped in exported packages, with clear licensing and a full regression suite, keeping the same LMS behaviour while removing `onunload` and `onbeforeunload` handlers
- SCORM, IMS: exported packages now group pages under a project root entry, which appears above the pages in the LMS table of contents
- SCORM: page status and score are now based on learner interaction with its activities; pages remain incomplete until every activity has been finished, are marked failed while the score is below 50 and passed from there on, while pages without activities are completed when the learner leaves them
- SCORM: activities that save the score automatically now send and commit it on every answer, so the platform index updates while the learner is still working on the page
- SCORM: opening or leaving a page no longer decides its result on its own; only what the learner does with the activities does
- SCORM: entering the access code now starts the activity and records it as started, just like clicking the start button
- SCORM: activities without a set weight now count the same as other activities, which may change scores on pages combining both types
- iDevices: activities can always be repeated
- Base and Universal styles: fully revised for accessibility, presentation and third-party licences, meeting WCAG 2.2 level AA
- Effects: improved accessibility and presentation of accordion, tab, pagination, carousel and timeline controls, with clearer focus indicators and improved contrast
- Styles: improved accessibility of menu and search controls in exported websites
- Universal style: dark mode is now disabled by default, except when exporting as a website
- Math: accessibility is now provided through browser MathML support, with hidden MathML always enabled so screen readers can announce formulas; removed the non-functional expression explorer, braille and read-aloud options from the MathJax menu
- Static distribution: removed unused resources, duplicated bundles and unreachable third-party files, and improved compression of the largest datasets
- Static Docker image: compressed content is now served, reducing download sizes by around 65%
- The "Import iDevice" button is now hidden until the feature is available

### Fixed

- SCORM 1.2: exported pages no longer rely on browser `onunload` and `onbeforeunload` handlers, preventing scores from being lost in Moodle
- SCORM: opening a page no longer records a score of zero and a failed result
- SCORM: leaving an untouched page no longer prevents the rest of the package from saving its results

## v4.0.0 – 2026-04-30

eXeLearning 4.0 is a complete rebuild of the application. Every part of the stack has been rethought, from the server runtime to the collaboration engine, the distribution model and the user interface. The following summarises the most significant changes since version 3.

### New technology stack

The server has been rewritten from scratch, moving from **PHP/Symfony/Mercure** to **Bun** (fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime), **Elysia** (lightweight HTTP framework) and **Kysely** (type-safe SQL query builder). The result is a faster server with lower memory usage, improved concurrency under load and a significantly simpler codebase.

### Three ways to use eXeLearning

- **Team Edition**: server installation, full online editor with real-time collaboration, user management, persistent project storage and database-backed persistence
- **Personal Edition**: online, fully functional static Progressive Web App (PWA) that runs entirely in the browser
- **Desktop**: local installation on device, native applications for Linux, Windows and macOS, built with Electron

### New admin panel

A new admin panel provides real-time visibility into the application, including activity metrics, active users, maintenance mode control and customisation options (application title, favicon, custom head HTML, and assets). This functionality was not available in version 3.

### Collaborative editing

The Yjs-based collaborative engine has been substantially improved. Multiple synchronisation and concurrency issues from version 3 have been resolved, including shared project deletion by non-owners, editor state loss on remote changes and block reorder inconsistencies. Collaborative sessions are now more reliable and consistent.

### File Manager

The File Manager has been improved in both usability and functionality. New features include file search, sorting options and a reference counter that shows where each asset is used within a project.

### LMS and platform integration

Compatibility with the latest Moodle plugins has been improved. The editor can be embedded in platforms such as WordPress, Moodle, Omeka-S or Drupal using iframe and postMessage, with a well-defined integration API. Host platforms can inject admin-approved custom styles, override themes or block style imports without rebuilding the editor bundle.

### iDevices

Significant improvements across multiple iDevices:

- **Rubric**: PDF export, CSV import/export and SCORM score support
- **Games**: native audio recording using the device microphone
- **Classify**: maximum number of categories increased from 4 to 9
- **Sort**: correct validation of exercises with identical cards
- **Scrambled List**: configurable number of attempts
- **Case Study**: separate labels for shown/hidden feedback states
- **GeoGebra Activity**: options to display title and author
- **DigCompEdu**: new iDevice for digital competence assessment
- All iDevices now include a link to the online usage manual within the editing interface

### Interface, accessibility and exports

- Project thumbnails (`screenshot.png`) are automatically generated on each save and included in `.elpx` archives
- Accessibility improvements in exported content, including proper heading structure, a skip navigation link and correct `<title>` elements per page
- Improved responsive layout: modals, preview panel and navigation menus adapt to low-resolution screens
- Teacher Mode: teacher-only content now includes a visual indicator in the editor
- Pages, boxes and iDevices excluded from export are now visually marked in the work area; related presentation and functionality issues have been resolved
- Export metadata has been improved: `content.xml` now records the actual eXeLearning version, and license information has been standardised

### Performance and reliability

Peak memory usage during save, preview and export has been significantly reduced, particularly in large projects. Asset persistence is now more robust and reliable across different environments.

### Deployment

Deployment of the Team Edition has been simplified. Configuration options have been streamlined, and documentation covering installation, environment variables and upgrade procedures has been improved.

### Internationalization

All languages have been reviewed. Languages with complete translations: **es, eu, ca, va, gl, ro, it, pt**. All other supported languages include automated placeholder translations to ensure full interface coverage.
