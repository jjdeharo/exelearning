/**
 * eXeLearning SCORM 1.2 runtime — activity registry layer.
 *
 * A page can carry any number of iDevices. This layer is the single place
 * that knows which of them exist, which ones the learner must finish, and how
 * far they got. It performs **aggregation only**: it never talks to the LMS
 * and holds no completion policy — exe-scorm12-policy.js turns a summary into
 * a cmi.core.lesson_status value.
 *
 * The separation matters because SCORM 1.2 has a single status element while
 * eXeLearning tracks completion and success independently:
 *
 *   iDevices  ──report──▶  activities (this layer)  ──summary──▶  policy
 *                                                                  │
 *                                                        client ◀──┘  (LMS)
 *
 * Persistence: the registry serialises itself into cmi.suspend_data with an
 * explicit version tag, migrates the unversioned payload written by
 * eXeLearning releases before this layer existed, ignores malformed data
 * instead of throwing, and compacts deterministically to stay inside the
 * SCORM 1.2 4096-character limit. Only structural data is stored — activity
 * identifiers, counters, scores, weights and pass marks — never learner names
 * or answers.
