/**
 * eXeLearning SCORM 1.2 runtime — completion policy layer.
 *
 * Turns the activity registry's summary (exe-scorm12-activities.js) into
 * SCORM 1.2 data model writes through the client layer
 * (exe-scorm12-client.js). SCORM 1.2 has a single status element,
 * cmi.core.lesson_status, so this layer is where eXeLearning's separate
 * notions of *completion* and *success* collapse onto one vocabulary.
 *
 * Which rules come from where:
 *
 * - SCORM 1.2 requirement: the lesson_status vocabulary; the LMS refuses
 *   "not attempted" from a SCO ([CR] 1.6.5); cmi.core.score.raw is mandatory
 *   while .min/.max are optional ([CR] §2.1.1.3a); cmi.core.exit is
 *   "suspend" for a resumable attempt.
 * - eXeLearning policy: an empty/"not attempted" status becomes "incomplete"
 *   on entry; a page with no required evaluable activity is "completed" by
 *   being viewed; the success threshold and its default; presentation-only
 *   activities never block completion; scores are validated to 0-100 before
 *   being sent.
 *
 * Both are spelled out in doc/development/scorm12-runtime-contract.md.
