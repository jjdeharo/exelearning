Every change must ship with colocated Vitest `*.test.js` coverage for edition and export logic, keep patch coverage ≥ 90% on changed lines, include a Playwright spec exercising the iDevice in the workarea and preview, and pass `make fix`, `make test-unit`, `make test-integration`, and `make test-e2e` before submission.

## When to Use

Creating or modifying interactive devices (iDevices) in `public/files/perm/idevices/base/`.

## Key Files

- `public/files/perm/idevices/base/<name>/` — iDevice root directory
- `public/files/perm/idevices/base/<name>/config.xml` — metadata (title, css-class, category, icon)
- `public/files/perm/idevices/base/<name>/edition/` — editor UI (JS + CSS)
- `public/files/perm/idevices/base/<name>/export/` — export rendering (JS + CSS)
- `public/files/perm/idevices/base/<name>/*-icon.svg` — icon asset
- `public/app/workarea/idevices/idevicesList.js` — iDevice registry
- `public/app/workarea/idevices/idevicesManager.js` — iDevice lifecycle management

**Reference iDevices** (well-tested, good to study): `checklist`, `rubric`, `geogebra-activity`

## Testing — Round-Trip Is Mandatory

Every iDevice **must** have a round-trip test: save data → load data → verify all fields are preserved. This is the #1 source of iDevice bugs — fields silently disappear when `loadData()` doesn't restore what `save()` stored. _Example: PR #1581._

### Edition Test Pattern

```javascript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest';

describe('my-idevice edition', () => {
    let idevice;
    beforeEach(async () => {
        document.body.innerHTML = '<div id="idevice-container"></div>';
        idevice = await global.loadIdevice('public/files/perm/idevices/base/my-idevice/edition/my-idevice.js');
    });

    it('round-trip: save then load preserves all fields', () => {
        // Set up editor state
        idevice.init(container, { title: 'Test', content: '<p>Hello</p>' });
        // Save
        const saved = idevice.save();
        // Load into fresh instance
        idevice.init(container, {});
        idevice.loadData(saved);
        // Verify ALL fields
        expect(idevice.getTitle()).toBe('Test');
        expect(idevice.getContent()).toContain('Hello');
    });
});
```

### Export Test Pattern

```javascript
function loadExportIdevice(code) {
    const modifiedCode = code
        .replace(/var\s+\$myidevice\s*=/, 'global.$myidevice =')
        .replace(/\$\(function\s*\(\)\s*\{\s*\}\);?\s*$/g, '');
    (0, eval)(modifiedCode);
    return global.$myidevice;
}
```

## Edition Lifecycle — Owning What You Create

An editor is opened and closed many times in one session. Anything the edition creates that can
outlive its form — a timer, a handler on `document`, a player, a pending read — must be owned by
the edition's lifecycle, or it keeps running after the editor is gone and, worse, can end up
driving the *next* iDevice the user opens.

`IdeviceNode` gives every edition an `EditionLifecycle`
(`public/app/workarea/project/idevices/content/editionLifecycle.js`) before calling `init()`, as
`this.$lifecycle`. Register through it and teardown is automatic. See [ADR-2293-01](../../../doc/architecture/adr/ADR-2293-01-own-idevice-edition-resources-with-an-explicit-lifecycle.md).

```javascript
init: function (element, data) {
    // Timers: cancelled on close. `this` is this edition instance.
    this.$lifecycle.setInterval(function () { this.refreshPreview(); }, 1000);

    // Handlers on shared targets: removed on close, by a namespace unique to
    // this edition, so unrelated handlers on document/window are untouched.
    this.$lifecycle.on(document, 'keydown', this.onKeyDown);

    // Native listeners: removed through the lifecycle's AbortSignal.
    this.$lifecycle.addEventListener(window, 'resize', this.onResize);

    // Anything with its own cleanup API — name the method, never assume one.
    this.$lifecycle.ownInstance(player, 'destroy');   // YouTube player
    this.$lifecycle.ownInstance(observer, 'disconnect');
    this.$lifecycle.ownMedia(audioElement);           // pause + release the stream
    this.$lifecycle.own(() => URL.revokeObjectURL(blobUrl));
    this.$lifecycle.ownFileReader(reader);            // abort an in-flight read
    this.$lifecycle.own(() => widget.teardown());     // anything else

    // Abortable requests, and file reads that always settle.
    fetch(url, { signal: this.$lifecycle.signal });
    const text = await this.$lifecycle.readFile(file, 'readAsText');
}
```

A resource the edition **rebuilds on every user action** — the audio preview, say — must name a
slot, or each action leaves one more live resource and one more disposer behind until the editor
closes. Owning into a slot releases whatever that slot held:

```javascript
this.$lifecycle.ownMedia(new Audio(url), 'previewAudio');
```

Wrapping a `FileReader` in a promise by hand is the one case the primitives get wrong on their own:
`abort()` fires no `error` event and a bound `loadend` no-ops, so the promise never settles and the
caller awaits it for the lifetime of the page. Use `readFile(file, method)`, which rejects with an
`AbortError` on teardown exactly as an aborted `fetch()` does.

**Never dereference the global inside a deferred callback.** When it finally runs, `$exeDevice`
usually holds a valid *different* device, so a `?.` guard passes and the callback edits the wrong
iDevice:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => $exeDevice?.refresh(), 500);                    // wrong
this.$lifecycle.setTimeout(function () { this.refresh(); }, 500); // right
```

Arrow callbacks ignore `this`, so capture the instance instead: `const self = this;`. A lexical
capture is bound to the instance that made it, which gives the same guarantee.

Form-local handlers (`$('#myFormField').on('click', ...)`) need nothing: the centralized teardown
unbinds the edition form through jQuery, which removes them. TinyMCE editors inside the form are
also disposed centrally — do not add your own.

`own()` disposers run last, in reverse order. If something must be cleaned up *before* them, add
the optional hook instead — it runs first, while the instance and its DOM are both still alive,
and at most once:

```javascript
destroyEdition: function () { /* ... */ },
```

## Commands

```bash
npx vitest run public/files/perm/idevices/base/<name>/edition/<name>.test.js
npx vitest run public/files/perm/idevices/base/<name>/export/<name>.test.js
make fix
```

## Gotchas

- **Round-trip data loss** — the #1 iDevice bug. If `save()` stores a field, `loadData()` must restore it. Always test `load(save(data)) === data` for every field. _Example: PR #1581._
- **Legacy metadata formats** — old iDevices may store data in fewer fields than current format. Tests must verify both old and new formats work.
- **Extra wrapper divs on re-import** — `IdeviceRenderer` wraps text in `<div class="exe-text">`. If your iDevice stores this HTML and re-imports it, wrappers accumulate. Normalize on import. _Example: PR #1559._
- **Missing `config.xml`** or wrong `<css-class>` — must match folder name convention.
- **Both `edition/` and `export/` are required** — missing either causes silent failures.
- **Icon naming** — must follow `<name>-icon.svg` pattern.
- **Use `escape()` for metadata persistence** — some iDevices use `escape()` for special characters in saved data. Be consistent with the existing pattern.
- **Resources that outlive the editor** — a raw `setInterval`, a `document` handler or a player left running after close keeps firing, and can drive the next iDevice the user opens. Register them through `this.$lifecycle` (see above). _Issues #2271, #2293._

## Done When

- [ ] `config.xml` with correct title, css-class, category, icon
- [ ] `edition/<name>.js` with `.test.js` including round-trip test
- [ ] `export/<name>.js` with `.test.js`
- [ ] Icon SVG present (`<name>-icon.svg`)
- [ ] Legacy format compatibility tested if modifying an existing iDevice
- [ ] Tests pass via `npx vitest run`
- [ ] `make fix` passes clean
